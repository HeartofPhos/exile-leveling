## Route

I'm not currently taking PRs related to route changes, my intention is to keep the base route in line with current speed running strategies.

Users are encourged to use the [Edit Route Tab](https://heartofphos.github.io/exile-leveling/#/edit-route) in the deployed app to update the route to their preferred playstyle.
